### Testing Structure

The project uses a co-located testing approach with `__tests__` directories alongside the source code:

```
src/
  ├── core/
  │   ├── __tests__/
  │   │   ├── EventPipeline.test.ts
  │   │   └── EventRouter.test.ts
  │   ├── EventPipeline.ts
  │   └── EventRouter.ts
  └── types/
      └── events.ts
```

This structure was chosen over a separate `tests/` directory for several reasons:

1. **Co-location**: Tests are placed next to the code they're testing, making it easier to find and maintain related files
2. **Import Clarity**: Relative imports are simpler and more intuitive when tests are co-located
3. **IDE Support**: Most IDEs provide better navigation and refactoring support when tests are next to their implementation
4. **Package Boundaries**: When the code is split into packages, co-located tests move with their code
5. **Test Discovery**: Jest automatically finds and runs tests in `__tests__` directories, making test discovery more reliable
